<h1> Linear Search</h1>

Linear Search is a simple search algorithm that checks each element of a list sequentially until the target value is found or the end of the list is reached.
ex  a[] = {1,3,45,67,89,21}
let suppose in this we want to search 45 elements 
</br>
then we compare this element to each element in the given list that is from a[o] index 
</br>
here we are nothing but searching elements linearly or sequentialy
